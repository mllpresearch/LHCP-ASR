OVERVIEW
--------

The LHCP-ASR dataset includes:

#### Speech data

<!--- * 287 hours of English-language manually transcribed speech data in the oncology domain. --->
* 30 hours of 2020 and 2022 LHCP plenary conference talks, with timed, manual (human) verbatim transcriptions, split into two sub-tasks, LHCP-2020 and LHCP-2022, with their respective development and test partitions.
* 205 hours of LHCP conference talks (2020, 2021, 2022), with timed, automatic verbatim transcriptions generated by a very competitive in-domain ASR system, for training or adaptation purposes.

#### Text data

* 1.5G tokens of in-domain English text data extracted from scientific papers and reports, PhD theses and news (1993--2025), to build in-domain language models.

CORPUS STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS
-----------------------------

Total size: 84 GiB (uncompressed)

The data is organized in 2 main directories: "speech" and "text" data.
Within the speech directory we can find two subdirectories, LHCP-2020
and LHCP-2022, one for each evaluation task (each with its own "dev" and
"test" subdirectories), and LHCP-train, with the samples for training.
For each talk, we provide a video file containing the speech of the talk;
the timed verbatim transcription in SRT (SubRip) format; and the slides
file used by the talk's main speaker in PDF or PPTX format. We also
provide, for the development and test sets, the normalised references
(lowercased, no punctuation) used to compute the WER%.
The "train" directory and each "dev" and "test" directory contain a
list with the IDs for all talks in case they are needed.

Inside the "text" top-level directory we can find the in-domain text
data gathered (up to February 2025) from two sources: the
[CERN Document Server (CDS)](https://cds.cern.ch/) repository, and
the [CERN News](https://home.cern/news) portal.
This data is organised into three sources: CERN-news, CDS-abstracts
and CDS-documents subsets. For each data source, we provide two
compressed text files: raw text, without any processing; and a
cleaned and normalised version (lowercased, no punctuation).

Here we can see more completely the corpus structure, with additional
subdirectories:
