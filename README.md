OVERVIEW
--------

The LHCP dataset includes:

#### Speech data

<!--- * 287 hours of English-language manually transcribed speech data in the oncology domain. --->
* 30 hours of 2020 and 2022 LHCP plenary conference talks, with timed, manual (human) verbatim transcriptions, split into two sub-tasks, LHCP-2020 and LHCP-2022, with their respective development and test partitions.
* 205 hours of LHCP conference talks, with timed, automatic verbatim transcriptions generated by a very competitive in-domain ASR system, for training or adaptation purposes.
* 1.5G tokens of in-domain English text data extracted from scientific papers and reports, PhD theses and news, to build in-domain language models.

The data is organized in 3 main directories: "train" (training data), "dev"
(validation data) and "test" (evaluation data).
Both "dev" and "test" directories contain one subdirectory for each sample
and a list containing the IDs of the samples of the set. Each sample directory contains
the audio file, the slides and two subdirectories: the first one contains the transcription
data, with the transcription in plain-text format, the aligned transcription in srt format,
and the aligned transcription in srt format but sentence-segmented. On the other hand, the
manual_translation subdirectory contains a folder for each target language (de, es, fr, sl;
according to ISO 639-1 standard), in which we can find the original manual translation,
the source and target language files temporally aligned, and the file with the timestamps
for that language pair.
The "train" directory contains one subdirectory for each sample and one list
for each subset of data as follows:
* train_audios.lst: contains the IDs of the training samples.
* train_slides.lst: contains the IDs of the samples with slides.
* train_trans.lst: contains the IDs of the samples with manual transcriptions.
* trains_trans+slides.lst: contains the IDs of the samples with manual transcriptions and slides.

Here we can see more completely the corpus structure, with additional
subdirectories:
